GraphAware Neo4j UUID
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphaware/neo4j-uuid.png)](https://travis-ci.org/graphaware/neo4j-uuid) | <a href="http://graphaware.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Downloads</a> | <a href="http://graphaware.com/site/uuid/latest/apidocs/" target="_blank">Javadoc</a> | Latest Release: 2.1.6.26.7

GraphAware UUID is a simple library that transparently assigns a UUID to newly created nodes in the graph and makes sure nobody
can (accidentally or intentionally) change or delete them. It also indexes nodes on their UUIDs.

Getting the Software
--------------------

### Server Mode

When using Neo4j in the <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-installation.html" target="_blank">standalone server</a> mode,
you will need the <a href="https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-framework" target="_blank">GraphAware Neo4j Framework</a> and GraphAware Neo4j UUID .jar files (both of which you can <a href="http://graphaware.com/downloads/" target="_blank">download here</a>) dropped
into the `plugins` directory of your Neo4j installation. After changing a few lines of config (read on) and restarting Neo4j, the module will do its magic.

### Embedded Mode / Java Development

Java developers that use Neo4j in <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/tutorials-java-embedded.html" target="_blank">embedded mode</a>
and those developing Neo4j <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-plugins.html" target="_blank">server plugins</a>,
<a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-unmanaged-extensions.html" target="_blank">unmanaged extensions</a>,
GraphAware Runtime Modules, or Spring MVC Controllers can include use the UUID as a dependency for their Java project.

#### Releases

Releases are synced to <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22uuid%22" target="_blank">Maven Central repository</a>. When using Maven for dependency management, include the following dependency in your pom.xml.

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.graphaware.neo4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>uuid</artifactId>
            <version>2.1.6.26.7</version>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>

#### Snapshots

To use the latest development version, just clone this repository, run `mvn clean install` and change the version in the
dependency above to 2.1.6.26.8-SNAPSHOT.

#### Note on Versioning Scheme

The version number has two parts. The first four numbers indicate compatibility with Neo4j GraphAware Framework.
 The last number is the version of the UUID library. For example, version 2.1.3.11.1 is version 1 of the UUID library
 compatible with GraphAware Neo4j Framework 2.1.3.11.


Setup and Configuration
--------------------

### Server Mode

Edit neo4j.properties to register the UUID module:

```
com.graphaware.runtime.enabled=true

#UIDM becomes the module ID:
com.graphaware.module.UIDM.1=com.graphaware.module.uuid.UuidBootstrapper

#optional, default is uuid:
com.graphaware.module.UIDM.uuidProperty=uuid

#Default is uuid:
com.graphaware.module.UIDM.uuidIndexName=uuidIndex

#optional, default is all nodes:
com.graphaware.module.UIDM.node=hasLabel('Label1') || hasLabel('Label2')

```

Note that "UIDM" becomes the module ID. 

`com.graphaware.module.UIDM.uuidProperty` is the property name that will be used to store the assigned UUID on the node. The default is "uuid".
`com.graphaware.module.UIDM.uuidIndexName` is the name of the legacy index that will be used to index nodes based on their uuid. The default is "uuidIndex" and the key used to index will be `com.graphaware.module.UIDM.uuidProperty`

`com.graphaware.module.UIDM.nodes` specifies either a fully qualified class name of [`NodeInclusionPolicy`](http://graphaware.com/site/framework/latest/apidocs/com/graphaware/common/policy/NodeInclusionPolicy.html) implementation,
or a Spring Expression Language expression determining, which nodes to assign a UUID to. The default is to assign the
UUID property to every node which isn't internal to the framework.


### Embedded Mode / Java Development

To use the UUID module programmatically, register the module like this

```java
 GraphAwareRuntime runtime = GraphAwareRuntimeFactory.createRuntime(database);  //where database is an instance of GraphDatabaseService
 UuidModule module = new UuidModule("UUIDM", UuidConfiguration.defaultConfiguration());
 runtime.registerModule(module);
 runtime.start();
```

Alternatively:
```java
 GraphDatabaseService database = new GraphDatabaseFactory().newEmbeddedDatabaseBuilder(pathToDb)
    .loadPropertiesFromFile(this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource("neo4j.properties").getPath())
    .newGraphDatabase();
 
 //make sure neo4j.properties contain the lines mentioned in previous section
```

Using GraphAware UUID
---------------------

Apart from the configuration described above, the GraphAware UUID module requires nothing else to function. It will assign a UUID to nodes configured,
and will prevent modifications to the UUID or deletion of the UUID property from these nodes by not allowing the transaction to commit.

### Server Mode

In Server Mode, are available via the REST API.

You can issue GET requests to `http://your-server-address:7474/graphaware/uuid/{moduleId}/node/{nodeId}/uuid` to get the UUID assigned to the node.
{moduleId} is the module ID the UUID Module was registered with. You can omit this part of the URL, in which case "UIDM" is assumed as the default value.
{nodeId} is the internal node ID.

GET requests to `http://your-server-address:7474/graphaware/uuid/{moduleId}/node/{uuid}` return the node ID for the node identified by {uuid}.
{moduleId} is the module ID the UUID Module was registered with. ou can omit this part of the URL, in which case "UIDM" is assumed as the default value.


### Java API

To use the Java API, please instantiate `UuidApi` and use one of its methods for getting the UUID.

```
UuidApi uuidApi = new UuidApi(database);
String uuid = uuidApi.getUuidByNodeId(nodeId);
long nodeId = uuidApi.getNodeIdByUuid(uuid);
```

In case the UUID Module is registered with ID different than "UIDM", then
the ID must be specified when constructing the reader.

```
UuidApi uuidApi = new UuidApi(database,"ModuleID");
String uuid = uuidApi.getUuidByNodeId(nodeId);
long nodeId = uuidApi.getNodeIdByUuid(uuid);
```

Please refer to Javadoc for more detail.
